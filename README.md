## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

This is a minimal homepage Iâ€™ll start from in todayâ€™s tutorial. Â 

> [!note]
> Iâ€™ve already connected my Obsidian vault to GitHub with the **Enveloppe** plugin and published the site with **Flowershow**. (If you need help with that, thereâ€™s a separate videoâ€”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8km17DPf0GM)

## Whatâ€™s next

Weâ€™ll create:
1. `/blog` directory + a first post Â 
2. A landing page at `/blog` with the `List` component Â 
3. Author pages (e.g., `/team/jane-smith.md`) Â 
4. Navigation link to **Blog** Â 
5. Draft controls (exclude folders or `publish: false`) Â 
6. Newsletter form embed Â 
7. Theme selection in `config.json`

Letâ€™s build it step by step!
